# Buy my things

This is a little project I am building to learn how to use Pocketbase as a framework with Go. Also I need to sell my things so that I can move across the world.

This is turning out to be a little more difficult than expected, as the documentation for Pocketbase as a framework is very sparse, and I am new to Go. Let's give it a shot anyway.

## Running this

`task watch_all` will watch templ for changes to the htmx templates and recompile them, and also generate a new build if anything in the go application changes. It works most of the time.
