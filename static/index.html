    <h1>Buy my things</h1>
    <p>Hello, my friend. If you are here it may be because you are interested in buying my things.</p>
    <p>My things are things that have been loved. Most of them were purchased and lived with me here in Vienna after painstakingly extensive research in to their utility. I can vouch for the usefulness of these things.</p>
    <p>Some of these things may be unused. In the case of such things, flaws were found in the robustness of my research. This is not a comment on the usefulness of said thing, but their existence on this website can be taken as an insight in to the fallibility of man.</p>
    <p>I probably will not be able to accept returns of things should you purchase them from me, due to my being on the other side of the world. However if you do find yourself in Sydney with one of my ex-things, I will consider an exchange for one of the things I have purchased in that future life.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my internet website, and I hope to see you again some day.</p>
